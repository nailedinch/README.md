I can't always view your cards due to their unavailability in my country. My vpn has been working like shit lately, so if I come to you, but I'm on your dni or something, gently purr at me, I'm not doing this on purpose.
I subscribe on people randomly, mostly collecting their profiles like cool rocks, so don't mind me

I don't like describing my interests outside of a dialogue much and believe in chance encounters, so you'd better ask me personally if we have something else in common

**current fandoms:**
disco elysium, idv, deltarune, trigun, postal, fear and hunger, dmc, breaking bad... not to mention great plans and unfinished ones

[movies](https://boxd.it/81CFL); cute space for a spotify link

I'm into all kinds of doomed toxic ~yaoi~ things, blood and meat, but only in terms of fiction. I love you, all humans and inhumans, and have nothing against the differences, but if you're seeing my manner as arrogant or else, then uh bye


**Dni:**
basic, antis, rp, systems, neopronouns users with no alt normative/-ish one, under 16

I hide freely and don't care being hided, but know that my invisible ass can land on you at any moment

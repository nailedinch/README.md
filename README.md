***Larcis, 17, [any prns](https://pronouns.cc/@hyperlinkblocked)***

rus/self taught eng, so take care.
c+h and interactions are welcome. it's okay to sit next to me even if we haven't talked 

I don't like describing my interests outside of a dialogue and believe in chance encounters, so ask me personally about anything else (ok, I'm lazy, I'll make the lists later)

**Dni:**
basic, antis, rps, systems or under 15

I like all humans and inhumans, but I'm not a fan of using neopronouns, feeling silly doing so. I don't know much tontags, but you can tell and teach me which ones would help you

I hide freely and don't care being hided, but know that my invisible ass can land on you at any moment
